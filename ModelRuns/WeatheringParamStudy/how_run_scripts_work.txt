How the Grain Hill Dakota runs work
May 2017

Start by copying the following files into your master run folder:

o dakota_param_study.in
o grain_hill_dakota_run_driver.py
o [TODO: ADD FILES]

In the file grain_hill_run_config.py, set the source path (i.e., the directory containing
the model files) and the "jobsub" option, which should be "None" (for local), or "qsub"
(for beach).

Run:

dakota -i dakota_param_study.in -o dakota.out > run.log &


What happens:

o Dakota picks parameter values for a run, then calls the analysis driver
  grain_hill_dakota_run_driver.py
  
o grain_hill_dakota_run_driver.py reads from grain_hill_run_config.py, which is the file
  one needs to modify to set whether this is local or HPCC, and set source folder.

o IF this is a local run:
  - calls run_grain_hill_local.sh, sending it the source path
  - run_grain_hill_local calls dakota_friendly_driver.py
  - dakota_friendly_driver reads the parameter input file inputs.txt, instantiates a
    GrainHill model, runs it, analyzes its maximum elevation and mean slope, and writes
    these to file results.out.

  ELSE if this is on beach:
  - makes a unique name for this job
  - calls qsub to submit run_grain_hill_beach.sh
  - writes a results.out file with dummy values, which leads dakota to advance to the next
    run
