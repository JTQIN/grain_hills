Ok, what's the point here? It's really that, well, a couple of things. You know, we need a theory for steep slopes. Need to honor

Hillslopes take on a delightful array of forms...

That is to say, there are lots of different kinds of hillslopes

Hillslopes take on a rich variety of forms. Their profile shapes may be convex-upward, concave-upward, planar, or some combination of these. Some slopes are completely mantled with soil, whereas others are bare rock, and still others draped in a discontinuous layer of mobile regolith. The processes understood to be responsible for shaping them are equally varied, ranging from disturbance-driven creep to dissolution to large-scale mass movement events.

Considerable research has been devoted to understanding the evolution of soil-mantled slopes that are primarily governed by disturbance-driven creep, such as down-slope soil transport by biotic and abiotic soil-mixing processes. As a result, the geomorphology community has mathematical models that account well for observed slope forms and patterns of regolith thickness \citep[e.g.,][]{roering2008how}. Furthermore, stochastic-transport theory provides a mechanistic link between the statistics of particle motion, the resultant average rates of downslope transport, and the emergence of convex-upward, soil-mantled slope forms \citep{culling,furbish}.

One gap that remains, however, lies in understanding steep, rocky slopes. ``Rocky'' implies slopes that lack a continuous soil cover; here, transport laws that assume the existence such a cover no longer apply. ``Steep'' implies angles approaching or exceeding the effective angle of repose for loose, granular material, so that ravel may be an important transport model \citep[e.g.][]{gabet,lamb,stock} and particles have the potential to fall as soon as they are released from bedrock. Rocky slopes are rarely completely barren; more commonly, they have a patchy cover of loose scree, which could either retard rock weathering by shielding the rock surface from moisture or temperature fluctuations, or enhance it by trapping water and allowing limited plant growth. A discontinuous cover does not fit easily within the popular exponential-decay regolith-production models [SOME REF], which assume an essentially continuous soil mantle.

The geomorphology community has a well-developed continuum-mechanics theory for the evolution of 

Mathematical models for the evolution of convex, soil-mantled hillslopes, founded on ...

well, look, some of the basic issues are:

- we don't have good models for the evolution of relatively steep, rocky slopes

- we have continuum mathematical models for soil-mantled slopes, as well as stochastic-process models that link the statistics of particle motion to slope form and long-term evolution (Furbish). But we don't have much in the way of a computational framework that links these two views, allowing one to experiment with how processes associated with individual disturbance and sediment-motion events translate into hillslope forms and dynamics.

It's really these two that we're addressing here...
